# frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game (Project #4)
=================================================================
## How to Run the game
Download the files.  Open the index.html file in a web browser (root directory).  JavaScript files need to be in subdirectory **root/js**.  Images need to be in subdirectory **root/images**.  CSS files in subdirectory **root/css**.
## How to Play the Game
Try and move the player from the starting position to the water without being hit by enemy bugs.  Use the keyboard arrow keys to move the player.  If you make it to the water you win, if you are hit by enemy bugs you lose.  Either way hit the spacebar to reset the game and start over.
## Project Goals and Instructions
Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
